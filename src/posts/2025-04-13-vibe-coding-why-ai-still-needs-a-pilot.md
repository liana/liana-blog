Liana Leahy explores the limitations of AI-assisted coding tools like Cursor, arguing that experienced programmers remain essential despite automation advances.

## The Experiment

The author's team introduced Cursor to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) with structured prompt templates, expecting non-programmers could contribute directly to AI development. However, the SMEs "quickly found themselves… well, hopelessly lost," despite their domain expertise.

## Recurring Issues

Leahy identifies recurring issues where AI generates suggestions that mirror junior programmer mistakes:

- Unclear variable/function naming
- Unnecessarily complex solutions
- Violation of DRY principles
- Premature optimization
- Inadequate error handling
- Over-engineering

**Critical insight:** "Cursor, left to its own devices, would get itself into tangled webs of logic," requiring constant human guidance and correction. The AI failed to recognize similar errors across codebases and rarely requested clarification when lacking context.

## The Pilot Metaphor

The post draws an analogy to commercial aviation: modern planes contain sophisticated automation, yet experienced pilots remain indispensable for safe operations. Similarly, AI coding tools excel as "co-pilots" but cannot replace human expertise in architecture, design principles, and problem-solving.

## Conclusion

While AI-assisted development shows promise, "vibe coding" remains unrealistic for non-programmers. These tools amplify experienced developers' capabilities far more than democratizing coding broadly.
