The post explores three key distinctions in managing AI-driven products versus traditional software.

## Managing Uncertainty

Traditional software operates deterministically, but AI introduces variability in outcomes. The author emphasizes setting appropriate user expectations, using Spotify's music recommendation approach as an example of creating engaging experiences without promising perfection.

## Testing Approaches

Beyond standard A/B testing, AI product managers must monitor for model drift, bias, and edge cases. GitHub Copilot serves as a case study—requiring validation not just for code generation but for security, ethics, and licensing compliance.

## Ethical Stewardship

The piece stresses that product managers must ask "should we build this?" alongside "can we build this?" The author references harm caused by inadequate safety consideration in AI implementations.

## Future Challenges

Upcoming priorities include transparency demands, regulatory evolution, sophisticated user understanding, and market differentiation.

## Core Recommendation

The author advises deeply understanding user problems first, building strong data science relationships, and maintaining ethics as your foundational principle. Success comes from creating trustworthy solutions rather than deploying advanced technology alone.
