Welcome to **Lyrics & Logic** - a space where I explore the fascinating intersection of creativity and technology, performance and product, curtain calls and code commits.

## From Curtain to Code

My journey to tech wasn't a straight line. Before I was debugging code, I was reading scripts. Before I was shipping features, I was performing on stage. The transition from the arts to engineering might seem unusual, but I've found that the skills I developed in performance translate beautifully to product management and software development.

## Why This Blog?

I'm starting this blog to share:

- **Technical insights** from my work in software development
- **Product management** strategies and lessons learned
- **Career transition** stories and advice
- **The creative side** of building technology

## What's Next?

In upcoming posts, I'll be diving into topics like:

- Building user-centric products
- The art of technical communication
- Balancing creativity with analytical thinking
- Real-world case studies from my work

Thanks for joining me on this journey. Let's build something amazing together.
