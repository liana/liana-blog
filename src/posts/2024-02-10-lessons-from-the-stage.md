When people learn about my background in performance, they often ask: "How did you go from theater to tech?" The truth is, the transition was more natural than you might think.

## Understanding Your Audience

In theater, everything starts with understanding your audience. Who are they? What do they expect? How will they react? These same questions drive product development:

- **User research** is like studying your audience demographics
- **User testing** mirrors dress rehearsals
- **Product launches** are opening night

## The Power of Iteration

Every performance is different. You learn from audience reactions, adjust your delivery, refine your timing. In product development, we call this **iteration**:

1. Ship a feature
2. Gather feedback
3. Improve and iterate
4. Repeat

## Collaboration is Everything

Theater is inherently collaborative. No show succeeds without:

- Directors (Product Managers)
- Actors (Engineers)
- Stage crew (Operations)
- Designers (UX/UI)

Sound familiar? Building products requires the same level of coordination and trust.

## Embrace the Unexpected

In live performance, things go wrong. You drop a line, miss a cue, or face technical difficulties. The show must go on. This resilience translates directly to tech:

- **Production incidents** require calm problem-solving
- **Changing requirements** demand flexibility
- **Failed experiments** are learning opportunities

## Conclusion

My journey from curtain to code taught me that creativity and logic aren't opposites - they're complementary forces. The best products, like the best performances, require both.

What unexpected skills have you brought from a previous career into tech? I'd love to hear your story.
