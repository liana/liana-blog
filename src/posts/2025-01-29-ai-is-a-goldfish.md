The post explores why AI systems struggle with memory retention in conversations. Leahy uses the "goldfish" metaphor to illustrate how AI models essentially start fresh with each message, lacking persistent memory of previous exchanges.

## The Core Problem

The author notes that sending entire conversation histories repeatedly creates "higher server costs" and "slower response times," frustrating users seeking quick answers.

## Proposed Solution

Rather than forcing AI to remember everything, Leahy advocates combining AI with traditional software engineering tools:

### 1. Datastores

Traditional databases store essential conversation details instead of requiring the model to retain everything.

### 2. Business Logic

Decision-making systems determine what information matters, when to update it, and how to summarize efficiently.

### 3. Context Management

Strategic delivery of relevant information to AI during interactions.

## Conclusion

The article emphasizes that effective conversational AI requires integration of proven software engineering practices alongside AI models. Neither component alone is sufficient; the synergy between robust databases, thoughtful logic, and AI creates superior user experiences compared to AI working independently.
