Liana Leahy explores how organizations should implement AI thoughtfully rather than recklessly. She identifies critical risks in deploying unstructured chat interfaces and proposes structured prompting as a solution.

## Key Concerns with Free-Text AI

The author highlights three primary dangers of open chat boxes:

### 1. Data Security

Users may inadvertently share confidential documents or customer information, causing irreversible data leaks.

### 2. Inconsistent Quality

Response quality depends entirely on user prompt-writing ability, undermining system reliability.

### 3. Safety Vulnerabilities

Users can craft prompts that circumvent safety guardrails.

## Proposed Solution: Structured Prompting

Rather than allowing direct user-to-AI interaction, Leahy advocates building system-controlled prompt construction. Her example demonstrates how a colleague's simple question about expense reports triggers the system to retrieve relevant policy documents and craft a precise instruction for the AI, resulting in structured, accurate output.

## Human-in-the-Loop Implementation

The author champions transparent AI systems where users provide targeted feedback on three dimensions:

- Data source accuracy and relevance
- System prompt effectiveness
- Output clarity and helpfulness

This feedback loop trains the underlying model while maintaining user agency and transparency, transforming the relationship from passive consumption to collaborative refinement.
