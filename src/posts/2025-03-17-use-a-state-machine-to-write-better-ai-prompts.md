Leahy argues that engineering-trained professionals excel at crafting AI prompts because they think in "structured, linear pathways that AI can follow." The piece identifies key prompt characteristics: specificity, structure, context, explicit instructions, and examples.

## The Core Recommendation

The core recommendation uses state machines as frameworks for AI reasoning. According to Leahy, "They break down complex problems into clear steps that both you and the AI can follow" and help prevent disconnected logical leaps in responses.

## Real-World Application

The author provides a five-state information collection process:

- **State 1:** Welcome/orientation
- **State 2:** Gathering details sequentially
- **State 3:** Verification/summary
- **State 4:** Confirmation checkpoint
- **State 5:** Completion

## Template Provided

Leahy offers a reusable prompt template structured around four states: understanding the problem, breaking it into components, solving incrementally, and synthesizing results.

## Conclusion

The author acknowledges ongoing learning, noting that "balance is crucial" between over-complication and insufficient structure, with optimal complexity depending on task requirements.
