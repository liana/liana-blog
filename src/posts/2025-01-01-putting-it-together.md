excerpt: "Drawing parallels between Stephen Sondheim's composition and software development - how creative vision requires patient, meticulous execution."
---

Sondheim's "Putting it Together" from _Sunday in the Park with George_ speaks to something deeper than just painting. It's a profound reflection on any creative process – including the complex journey of software development.

You see it every day in our work: that gap between vision and reality. Ideas flow easily in planning meetings, but the real work? That's in the trenches of execution. It's in every decision about architecture, every debugging session, every compromise between what we dreamed and what we can deliver.

Think about your last major project. Remember all those tiny decisions? Each git commit, each API choice, each performance trade-off – they're all brushstrokes on a canvas. Your "killer app" doesn't spring fully formed from a product spec. Instead, it emerges gradually through countless hours of coding, testing, and refinement.

Just like Sondheim's artist carefully selects colors and applies each brushstroke, you're crafting something through every choice you make – balancing functionality, performance, and user experience. It's not just about writing code. It's about putting it together, piece by piece, until your vision becomes reality.
