# About Liana

## From Curtain to Code

Hi! I'm Liana Leahy, and I'm passionate about building products that make a difference. My journey to tech was unconventional - I started my career in the performing arts before transitioning into software development and product management.

## What I Do

Today, I work at the intersection of technology and user experience, focusing on:

- **Product Management**: Building user-centric products that solve real problems
- **Software Development**: Writing clean, maintainable code that ships value
- **Technical Communication**: Bridging the gap between technical and non-technical teams
- **Mentorship**: Helping others navigate their own career transitions

## My Background

- 🎭 **Performance Arts**: Theater, musical performance, and stage production
- 💻 **Software Development**: Full-stack development with modern JavaScript frameworks
- 📊 **Product Management**: User research, roadmapping, and cross-functional leadership
- 🎓 **Continuous Learning**: Always exploring new technologies and methodologies

## Why "Lyrics & Logic"?

The name represents my journey and philosophy:

- **Lyrics** symbolize creativity, expression, and the arts
- **Logic** represents analytical thinking, systems, and code
- Together, they show that the best solutions combine both
