# About Liana

Liana Leahy combines deep technical expertise with a collaborative leadership style to deliver innovative, regulated digital products.

## From NYC Stages to Silicon Valley

Hey there! I'm Liana, and I've had quite the multi-career adventure. My journey started in NYC, where I combined software development by day with theatrical performance at night.
