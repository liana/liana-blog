<div class="space-y-6">
  <p class="text-gray-200">I'm a Silicon Valley native who studied Computer Science and Theater at Smith College, which pretty much sums up my approach to building products—balancing technical precision with human empathy. My career has taken me from developing financial software and performing in off-Broadway musicals in NYC, to leading technical development at Harvard's Berkman Center alongside Vint Cerf on StopBadware, a cyber-justice initiative protecting internet users. I've built high-scale social games for millions of players, led digital transformation at the MBTA (winning a 2019 Webby Honoree award), and served as Director of Product Management at Woebot Health, where I focused on the ethical deployment of AI chatbots for mental health. Currently, I'm a Principal Product Manager Technical at Amazon Robotics, leading the strategic definition of operations software to enhance facility efficiency. Throughout my career, I've moved from engineering to product management because I became fascinated with not just how things are built, but why—and when I'm not obsessing over product roadmaps, you'll find me making music and learning new instruments, because the best products, like the best performances, require both technical skill and constant practice.</p>
