  <p class="text-gray-200">Hey there! I'm Liana, and I've had quite the multi-career adventure. My journey began in NYC where <em>by day</em> I developed everything from financial systems to client management tools and <em>by night</em> you could see me singing and dancing off-broadway and national tour.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-200">After moving to Boston, I joined forces with Google and Harvard's Berkman Center to battle malware, created Facebook games that reached millions of players alongside industry veteran Jon Radoff, and delved into the fascinating world of behavioral science at WeSpire.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-200">I learned about Product Management at MeYou Health, where I partnered with major insurance plans and hospitals to deliver wellness solutions that truly made a difference.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-200">These days, I'm honored to be working at Woebot Health, where I'm steering our enterprise solutions to revolutionize mental health care.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-200">When I'm not at work, you'll find me paying it forward through mentoring and building up the tech community, especially for women in tech.</p>
